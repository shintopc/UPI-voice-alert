# UPI Voice Alert - Mobile Soundbox 📢

**UPI Voice Alert** turns your Android phone into a **Payment Soundbox**. It announces UPI payment receipts out loud in real-time, functioning exactly like the dedicated hardware soundboxes found in shops, but using your existing smartphone.

Ideal for shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners who want instant audio confirmation of payments without buying extra hardware.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔊 Instant Voice Alerts

- **Universal Support**: Works with **Google Pay (GPay)**, **PhonePe**, **Paytm**, and **BHIM**.
- **Background Reliability**: Works flawlessly even when the phone is **Locked**, **Sleeping**, or the screen is **Off**.

### 🗣️ Multi-Language Support
Speaks in your local language with native number pronunciation:
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇮🇳 Hindi (हिंदी)
- 🌴 Malayalam (മലയാളം)

### ⚙️ Powerful Customization
- **Voice Speed Control**: Adjust the speaking rate from 0.5x (Slow) to 2.0x (Fast).
- **Scheduled Mute**: Set a "Do Not Disturb" schedule (e.g., 10 PM to 6 AM) to automatically silence alerts at night.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security (Privacy First)

- **No Bank Access**: The app **NEVER** asks for bank passwords or UPI PINs. It simply reads the notification text.
- **No Data Collection**: No financial data is sent to any server.

## 🔋 Battery Optimization Fix
Modern Android phones often kill background apps to save battery. UPI Voice Alert includes a built-in **Diagnostic Tool** that:
- Detects if the app is restricted.
- Guides you to "Ignore Battery Optimizations" to ensure 24/7 reliability.

## 🚀 How It Works
1.  **Install & Permission**: Grant "Notification Access" so the app can detect payment messages.
2.  **Select Language**: Choose your preferred language in Settings.
3.  **Receive Payment**: When a customer pays via UPI, your payment app (e.g., GPay) sends a notification.
4.  **Speak**: This app reads the notification, parses the amount (e.g., "Received Rs 100"), and speaks it out loud!
